            <h2>Hello my name is Connor McGaughey.</h2>
            <p>
                I am from and live in Bolton (Greater Manchester). 
                I have been learning to code for over a year with IT career switch and Codecademy with the ambition of becoming a professional coder / programmer. 
                Prior to starting the course I had no previous experience and found that throughout my learning journey I have come accross many hurdles that I have had to overcome, 
                however this has never discouraged me and in the challenges I faced I learned many lessons and now reached a point where I am able to say I am a compitent developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've found that the sense of accomplishment you get from solving a problem or fixing a bug feels extremley rewarding and have come to realise that the amount to learn and the potential of coding are infinte. 
                This makes me excited to see what I will be able to accomplish in my career. 
            </p>

                Outside of coding I have always been someone who is active and enjoys to learn and share new things. 
                This has manifested in many ways in my life and can be seen through my hobbies my main one being combat sports. 
                From the age of seven I have competed in freestyle wrestling and judo. 
                I then thought I should try MMA due to the multiple dicipline aspect of MMA I found that the best way to improve was to suround myself with team-mates who have lots of experience. 
                Through this colabiration of me sharring my grappling skillset with my team-mates and them helping me in areas I was weaker on we managed to improve our capability and evolve together.
